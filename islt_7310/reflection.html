        <h4> Thien-an Truong</h4>
        <p class="tab"> When I started college, I was unsure about what I wanted to pursue. I thought it was computer science, but I quickly learned that it wasn’t for me.<br/> 
            I eventually self-taught myself to edit at a decent level and decided I wanted to try out digital storytelling.<br/> 
            I’ve learned alot about my video production, editing, photography, and digital storytelling overall throughout my years at college so far -- and I am continuing to learn and grow as I continue to pursue a bachelors in digital storytelling.</p>
        <p class="tab"> My interest in directing and editing started in middle school when I would I take a film class with some friends.<br/> 
            I enjoyed the creativity and the possibilities that making films  had. We didn’t learn much about editing, besides combing clips, but I would go home and try to learn new and creative ways to make my videos stand out. 
            After that class, I never really went back to filming or editing and kind of forgot about how much fun I had until college.</p>
        <p class="tab"> I started to edit in college again when I started getting really good at video games. I would have clips of my impressive plays in different video games and I would edit montages of them to different songs.<br/> 
            I had so much fun relearning how to edit and it was something I got really passionate about which led me to change my major during my sophomore year.<br/>
        <p class="tab">My goal in the future is to work on music videos. Two of my passions, music and film combined.<br/> 
                It might be ambitious, but I would like to work my way up until I am able to work with mainstream artists - but that is a very long way to go as I am still learning and getting the hang of things.</p>
