    Hi, my name is Thien-an [T-non]. I'm a currently a junior and I'm majoring in digital storytelling. I've done a very small amount of HTML in high school, but I forgot most of it by now. During this cource, I expect to learn HTML at a decent level and would like to learn how to set up and publish websites. I hope to be able to create websites to show off my porfolio or certain thigns from my porfolio. My favorite hobbies mostly include following sports such as football, basketball, and soccer. I also enjoy video games and watching random movies.
