        <h4> Thien-an Truong</h4>
        <p>I'm Thien-an Truong and welcome to my portfolio website. Here you will be able to see different examples of my work. You will be able to watch the different types of films that I’ve worked on, mostly directing and editing. You should be able to see my improvement throughout the years, as my videos will be from different stages of my experience. You should also be able to see my experience with multiple editing softwares, as I mainly used two editing softwares for my films (Adobe Premiere and DaVinci Resolve). This website will also allow you to see my photos that I’ve personally taken with my Nikon D5000 and edited with mostly adobe programs.
