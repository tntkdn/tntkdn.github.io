    <h3> About Me </h3>
    <p> My name is Thien-an Truong. I was born and raised in the city of St. Louis in Missouri. I went to a high school there called Metro Academic and Classical High School. <br/> After applying to many schools, I finally decided on University of Missouri aka Mizzou. Leaving high school, I thought I wanted to code and create softwares, so I decided to test out computer science and found out it wasnâ€™t for me. I took a digital storytelling class because it seemed interesting and decided to change to major to digital storytelling and the rest is history. </p>
